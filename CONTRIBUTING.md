## Contribute via pull requests

If you want to add a technology to the list, please file a [Pull Request][PR] with a short explanation why you think it should be added to the list.

## Opening issues

If you spot something missing or wrong in the list, feel free to [open an issue][IS] with a detailed explanation of what you think needs to be added or changed.
